 No important software for the Mac depends on Java.
 I think he meant “I don’t have any important software that depends on Java”. There. Fixed that for you.
What I like about the most about his subsequent backpedaling is that it avoids the original issue people were complaining about.
 Gruber says Java isn’t supported in the new MacOS X 10.</h2>

I’ve long thought that TODO lists were overdue for an IMAP style, access this anywhere from any client, protocol. Nice to see Apple implementing it and it looks like they’re skipping the design-a-new-protocol phase and just using IMAP for the TODO list.</h2>

The meat is in the comments which are very polite and informative. I’ve only played with Squeak once back in college so I didn’t really grasp the whole editing-live-objects-which-don’t-live-in-files thing.
It sounds pretty neat and pretty powerful.</h2>

It would be different if they had some standard which any store which plays music could appear on the iPod/iPhone for purchasing. But I don’t like being told which stores I should shop at.

But when you have to run it by hand over 3000 subversion revisions, looking for the place where you introduced a memory leak, and after four steps you’ve eliminated 93% of the search space, you get a new appreciation for it.
There are some tools out there for automating these searches through subversion. They didn’t fit our problem though because determining whether we were showing a memory leak was fuzzy.</h2>

Two downsides:
 the language is going to be that much more complicated. I’m looking at you, separate meta-type system for controlling templates it took so long for the STL and templates to get good enough support, I doubt I’ll see any of this until 2015  </h2>

 I totally believe Jobs’s story that it’s a complete re-write. The old iMovie was a good app, as a sort of stripped-down consumer-level Final Cut — but it still wasn’t any good for just putting clips together in a few minutes.
 This makes very little sense to me. What about those of us who want to spend time working on their movies but who want to avoid Final Cut Pro/Express?</h2>
