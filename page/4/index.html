                    AppleEvents: Apple&amp;#8217;s worst documented API?
                    
                        
                            <h2>If you are trying to register a callback on getting a URL passed to your program through AppleEvents, don’t use the documented kAEInternetSuite and kAEISGetURL enums. They are defined as ‘gurl’, but the actual value passed to your program is ‘GURL’. From what I can tell, everyone defines their own enums because this is well known.
Apple can’t fix it though, because it would break everyone’s software. So they keep documenting it as ‘gurl’, and we keep redefining it to the actual value.</h2>

In this case, a mutual funds analyst who says that it would be better to invest the money instead of buying an iPod. Which is a good point to make. Too many people fritter their money away on gadgets instead of investing it.
Not sure why that qualifies the man as a “jackass”, but Gruber throws that term around a lot anyways.</h2>

Then you have to open the project template files and comment out various obscure configurations if you want to have a workable setup.
Why are these many steps necessary?</h2>

They should be subtracting the current fees they’re already paying. I pay about $60 a month, which coincides with the $60 a month AT&amp;T plan that’s being offered. So really, my main consideration is whether I can afford the iPhone itself.</h2>

Right now, the best use of Twitter is as a distributed notification framework, like Growl, but the notifications show up on your cellphone.</h2>
