                            <h2>This is old news, in blog time, but Gruber’s response to Jalkut’s comment on the Leopard delay misses a couple points.
Gruber says:
 That’s right in the middle of the most productive stretch in Mac OS X history – 10.0.0 was released in March 2001, 10.1.0 was released in September, and 10.2.0 was released less than a year after that in August 2002.
 It only looks productive if you’re going by the numbering scheme.</h2>

With Ardour, we wanted to make it smarter. We wanted to be able to re-add Track 1 if the first track was deleted. But not if the first track had just been renamed.</h2>

Once it works, it works pretty good. I might run into some trouble in the future if I were to use a different tree than trunk, but that’ll be a good ways away.
I’m not too worried either because:</h2>

Sixteen people showed up and the following discussion, mostly with the Drupal team was very rewarding. There was applause afterwards.</h2>

I’m pretty excited. I’ll be leading a discussion of cheap, homegrown ways to reward contributors to open source projects.
Then, I’ll fly to LA to visit some friends. And since I’ve never been to California before, this is all new to me. Too bad I won’t have time to check out San Francisco.</h2>

Use my glue header. It will create glue functions at compile time for calling objc_msgSend() with the appropriate arguments.</h2>
