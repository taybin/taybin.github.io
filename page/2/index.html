 You need to specify values for the processInfoLength, processName, and processAppSpec fields of the process information structure. Specify the length of the process information structure in the processInfoLength field. If you do not want information returned in the processName and processAppSpec fields, specify NULL for these fields. Otherwise, allocate at least 32 bytes of storage for the string pointed to by the processName field and, in the processAppSpec field, specify a pointer to an FSSpec structure.</h2>

I don’t care if someone charges for an app or not. But one thing that has always puzzled me is why there are so many free (as in beer) applications for the mac that aren’t also open source. If you’re giving your application away for free, why not show the source too?
My only guess is that the default-to-open-source attitude isn’t as ingrained in the mac world as is it elsewhere.</h2>

The problem is he didn’t include any numbers beyond the LOCs. It would have been nice to have had some before and after numbers on execution speed, binary size, and memory usage.</h2>
